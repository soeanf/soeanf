### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm SÃ¶ren and I am a teacher at a german comprehensive school where I teach maths, chemistry and computer science. 

Although i have never officially learnt to code, I was so bored with dull repetitive tasks that I started writing little tools to work more efficiently. I currently work mainly with python, php and js, but wouldn't call myself an expert in them.
